# the variable FormatMode defines what the formatting tool will do
# FormatMode= SingleUC : generates ONE UCBlock for the first period (first SSVTimestep) of the dataset
# FormatMode= UC : generates a serie of UCBlocks for each period (each SSVTimestep) of the dataset
# FormatMode= SDDP : generates only the SDDPBlock
# FormatMode= SDDPandUC : generates the SDDPBlock and all the UCBlocks
# FormatMode= INVEST : generates the InvestmentBlock 
# FormatMode= INVESTandSDDP : generates the InvestmentBlock and the SDDPBlock
# FormatMode= INVESTandSDDPandUC : generates the InvestmentBlock and the SDDPBlock and all the UCBlocks
FormatMode: INVESTandSDDPandUC

# the variable FormatVU defines the input for Bellman values
# FormatVU= None : no bellman values are used as input
# FormatVU= PerReservoir :  bellman values computed independently reservoir per reservoir are used
# In this case all bellmanvalue files in the same hydrosystem must have the same number of volume steps
# the format of bellman values files for each upstream reservoir is 3 columns : dates, volume steps, corresponding bellman values
# the names of the columns must be Volume and Value
# FormatVU= Polyhedral :  A polyhedral function is used: \sum_i a_i*x_i+b (x_i being the volume of reservoir i)
# in this case there should exist one datafile per hydrosystem
# the format of this file is  2+N columns where N is the number of reservoirs: 
# first column: dates, 1 column per reservoir with the a coefficients, 1 column with value of b
# the names of the columns must be a_i (i from 0 to Number of reservoirs -1), and b
FormatVU: Polyhedral

# the variable IncludeVU defines when to include external water values in input
# IncludeVU= None : no bellman values are used as input
# IncludeVU= Last :  water values included only in the last Block
# IncludeVU= All :  water values included in all blocks
IncludeVU: All 

# the variable Invest defines if additionnal constraints are created for the investment optimisation
# Invest= Simple : no additional constraints are created
# Invest= NRJ : regions are autonomous in energy (ie the amount of energy is sufficient for each node)
# Invest= TargetRES: each region has a target of renewable energies
Invest: Simple

# dates information:
# - dayfirst: True if the format is giving the day first (01/07/2050 means first of july)

# - BeginDataset : first day of the instance to create
# - EndDataset: last day of the instance to create
